Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell cmd_rx/FSM_sequential_state[1]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) FSM_sequential_state_reg[0]/CLR, FSM_sequential_state_reg[1]/CLR, cmd_rx/FSM_sequential_state_reg[0]/CLR, cmd_rx/FSM_sequential_state_reg[1]/CLR, cmd_rx/cmd_msg_reg[0]/CLR, cmd_rx/cmd_msg_reg[1]/CLR, cmd_rx/cmd_msg_reg[2]/CLR, cmd_rx/cmd_msg_reg[3]/CLR, cmd_rx/cmd_msg_reg[4]/CLR, cmd_rx/cmd_msg_reg[5]/CLR, cmd_rx/cmd_msg_reg[6]/CLR, cmd_rx/cmd_msg_reg[7]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
